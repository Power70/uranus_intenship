        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
            As we all know, who controls the memes controls the universe and Uranus is on course to get pumped. We want to go deeper than a full moon.  So don’t pass gas on this one or else you’ll miss out on comedy gold. 

            Get it?

            No I mean really do you get it yet?

            We used to have a monetary system backed by gold, yet in this digital age it’s truly about that comedy gold. 

            It’s how we make you and your friends laugh while taking the crypto pill. 

            So swallow it whole and it’ll not be long till we connect this back to Uranus. 

            Currency is a shared belief system, its value is defined based on how we value it. 

            And now back to gold, gold worked great until 1971 when the US decided to stop being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shit coin was born.

            Thus, the ultimate source of power was formed. The ability to literally print money. 

            An instrument so powerful that those who had any form of access to it would do anything to protect it. 

            They sought to form control over it. 

            This is where the idea of a global mafia came from, and its real except rather than this running the town, they run the world. 

            Unlimited funding goes along way, and now it gave a reason to create conflict. Because printing money is key for war, and safety.
