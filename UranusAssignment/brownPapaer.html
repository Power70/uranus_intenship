            <p>It used to be white but then came Uranus. </p>
            <p>As we all know, wused to be whiteho controls the memes controls the universe and Uranus is on course to get pumped. We want to go deeper than a full moon.  So don’t pass gas on this one or else you’ll miss out on comedy gold.</p>
            <p>Get it?</p>
            <p>No I mean really do you get it yet?</p>
            <p>We used to have a monetary system backed by gold, yet in this digital age it’s truly about that comedy gold. </p>
            <p>It’s how we make you and your friends laugh while taking the crypto pill. </p>
            <p>So swallow it whole and it’ll not be long till we connect this back to Uranus.</p>
            <p>Currency is a shared belief system, its value is defined based on how we value it.</p>
            <p>And now back to gold, gold worked great until 1971 when the US decided to stop being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shit coin was born. </p>
            <p>(Elon musk tweet) </p>
            <p>Thus, the ultimate source of power was formed. The ability to literally print money. </p>
            <p>An instrument so powerful that those who had any form of access to it would do anything to protect it.</p>
            <p>They sought to form control over it. </p>
            <p>This is where the idea of a global mafia came from, and its real except rather than this running the town, they run the world.</p>
            <p>Unlimited funding goes along way, and now it gave a reason to create conflict. Because printing money is key for war, and safety. </p>
            <p>Make the world less safe? </p>
            <p>Start proxy wars?</p>
            <p>Profit.</p>
            <p>Incentives are kinda like assholes, its shitty when they’re not maintained. </p>
            <p>This exact understanding was what led the pioneers of Bitcoin and its early supporters into action. Led by something bigger than money… a cure to the printing machine whose societal effects are best found on wtfhappenedin1971.com</p>
            <p>While the Bankman Fried crypto for a bit, the inevitable nature of its existence has steamrolled into the hearts, minds, and wallets of this power itself. </p>
            <p>There’s been a vibe shift.</p>
            <p>The term “if you can’t beat em, join em” rings true.</p>
            <p>Institutions, who never want to lose power, saw the inevitable rise of Bitcoin forming, grabbed their own holdings and pushed great financial institutions into this wave. </p>
            <p>Sure, if Bitcoin wins we get sound money, but are we really going to settle in a time like this? Do we really think the horse and carriage is going to win this race?</p>
            <p>Bitcoin never taught you this, meaning to many, it’s just an investment.</p>
            <p>The true understanding of the self fulfilling prophecy of understanding our chance at a future by the people and for the people is written within the stars. </p>
            <p>Institutions will not back the memes before it is too late.</p>
            <p>Uranus could be the astronomical tool to make the global mafia take a big fat dump. </p>
            <p>If it’s your first time understanding the power of the meme token revolution, then welcome to the club. If this is the first token you’ve seen to actually get that deep, with a cosmic memeing beyond dog. </p>
            <p>Then you get where this all flushes out. </p>
            <p>So every time you wipe your ass and see that shit stain. </p>
            <p>You can remember you now know of the cosmic instrument that’s going to finally ring up the global mafia and take a shit on their control mechanism</p>
            <p>All government owned currencies are the real shit coins. </p>
            <p>So fear not, don’t fiat. </p>
            <p>We’ll continue to pump out on this one.</p>
            <p>The Bitcoin whitepaper was just the beginning, we all know it’s not just black or white. </p>
            <p>It’s humanity, we are just missing brown and together if we truly recognize we are the shit, then we can truly live in a future that is by the people and for the people once again. </p>
            <p>Uranus is perfectly placed to be a part of the revolution. </p>
            <p>The revolution will not be televised, it will be memed.</p>
