                It used to be white but then came Uranus.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we all know, who controls the memes controls the universe, and Uranus is on course to get pumped. We want to go deeper than a full moon. So don’t pass gas on this one or else you’ll miss out on comedy gold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get it?
            </p>
            <p>
                No? I mean, really, do you get it yet?
            </p>
            <p>
                We used to have a monetary system backed by gold, yet in this digital age it’s truly about that comedy gold. It’s how we make you and your friends laugh while taking the crypto pill. So swallow it whole and it’ll not be long until we connect this back to Uranus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currency is a shared belief system; its value is defined based on how we value it.
            </p>
            <p>
                And now back to gold. Gold worked great until 1971 when the US decided to stop being limited by a gold reserve. At this time, the biggest shitcoin was born. (Elon Musk tweet)
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, the ultimate source of power was formed: the ability to literally print money. An instrument so powerful that those who had any form of access to it would do anything to protect it.
            </p>
            <p>
                They sought to form control over it. This is where the idea of a global mafia came from, and it’s real, except rather than this running the town, they run the world. Unlimited funding goes a long way, and now it gave a reason to create conflict. Because printing money is key for war and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make the world less safe? Start proxy wars? Profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Incentives are kinda like assholes; it’s shitty when they’re not maintained. This exact understanding was what led the pioneers of Bitcoin and its early supporters into action. Led by something bigger than money… a cure to the printing machine whose societal effects are best found on wtfhappenedin1971.com.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the Bankman Fried crypto for a bit, the inevitable nature of its existence has steamrolled into the hearts, minds, and wallets of this power itself. There’s been a vibe shift.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” rings true. Institutions, who never want to lose power, saw the inevitable rise of Bitcoin forming, grabbed their own holdings, and pushed great financial institutions into this wave.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sure, if Bitcoin wins, we get sound money, but are we really going to settle in a time like this? Do we really think the horse and carriage is going to win this race?
            </p>
            <p>
                Bitcoin never taught you this, meaning to many, it’s just an investment. The true understanding of the self-fulfilling prophecy of understanding our chance at a future by the people and for the people is written within the stars.
            </p>
            <p>
                Institutions will not back the memes before it is too late. Uranus could be the astronomical tool to make the global mafia take a big fat dump.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it’s your first time understanding the power of the meme token revolution, then welcome to the club. If this is the first token you’ve seen to actually get that deep, with a cosmic memeing beyond dog, then you get where this all flushes out.
            </p>
            <p>
                So every time you wipe your ass and see that shit stain, you can remember you now know of the cosmic instrument that’s going to finally ring up the global mafia and take a shit on their control mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>
                All government-owned currencies are the real shitcoins. So fear not, don’t fiat. We’ll continue to pump out on this one. The Bitcoin whitepaper was just the beginning; we all know it’s not just black or white. It’s humanity; we are just missing brown and together if we truly recognize we are the shit, then we can truly live in a future that is by the people and for the people once again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Uranus is perfectly placed to be a part of the revolution. The revolution will not be televised; it will be memed.
